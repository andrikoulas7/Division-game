A simple game where you try to find the perfect numbers
Written as exercise for javascript
In the game now, by pressing the button a random number is generated and a 5x5 array is filled.
Your goal is to find the numbers where are divided with this number.
You have 30 seconds and by the end of time an alert box shows your percent of true guess.
